This is an online questionnaire system which was, until now, a private personal project.

However, I am struggling with some issues and would like to invite potential contributors to solve it.


------------

### ABOUT THE PROJECT
Online Questionnaire System (OQS) is an open-source examination management System that aims to create a simple yet feature-rich and robust means of testing and examining students.

### Features
Here are the basic (functional) requirements that I intend to integrate into the website: -

1. There are 4 types of users who should be able to access the website:

- Admin -> Has unsrestricted access to the website.
- Teacher / Educator -> Can create, edit and delete questions and choices created by them.
- Student -> Can only view question and select choices.
- Guest -> Can view every question, but not edit or update anything. They can also not view any choices.

2. Every question can have at max 5 choices, out of which only one will be true.
3. Every question can belong to more than one category. One category can also have multiple questions.
4. A teacher can create a question_set which will consist of a set of questions in a single place. One teacher can create multiple question_sets.

Planned Features: -
1. Sessions and cookies
2. Option to send a pdf of a student's score card to their email after they complete a test.
3. Generate a PDF of all the scorecards of a student for a particular month, year, academic-session, etc.
